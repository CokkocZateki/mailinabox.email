	    			<h2 id="checklist">Pre-flight Checklist</h2>

	    			<dl>
	    				<dt>Can I run my Mail-in-a-Box at home?</dt>
	    				<dd>No. Most residential servers are blocked from sending mail both on the sending end (your ISP) and on the receiving end (by <a href="http://www.spamhaus.org/pbl/">blacklists</a>) because residential computers are all too often hijacked to send spam. Your home IP address is also probably dynamic, which won&rsquo;t work for this. You&rsquo;ll almost certainly need to use a virtual machine in the cloud to have reliable mail delivery.</dd>

	    				<dt>What will it cost?</dt>
	    				<dd>This is going to cost you about $16 per month. You&rsquo;re going to become your own Internet service provider &mdash; an ISP. You can divide this among friends and share your Mail-in-a-Box if you&rsquo;d like to split it up. Most of the cost is in having a (virtual) machine connected to the Internet 24/7.</dd>

	    				<dt>Do I have time?</dt>
	    				<dd>There&rsquo;s also your time. Once a Mail-in-a-Box is set up, we hope it &ldquo;just works&rdquo; but when you are your own system administrator you must be prepared to resolve issues as they arise.</dd>

	    				<dt>How will this affect my website? (Advanced.)</dt>
	    				<dd>
		    				<p>If your website is just HTML pages and static files, you can copy it onto your Mail-in-a-Box for a really simple hosting solution. If you have a website already, be aware that your Mail-in-a-Box wants to take over your DNS so that it can configure it correctly for email, and we recommend you let the box do that. But the box will let you customize the DNS at the end of setup if you have another server running your domain name&rsquo;s website.</p>
		    				<p>Because Mail-in-a-Box configures your DNS to prevent unauthorised senders <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spoofing">forging</a> mail from your domains we recommend that you only create custom A & AAAA records for any webservers that you may have, and if they need to send email that you configure them to <a href="#relaying">relay via your Mail-in-a-Box</a>.</p>
	    				</dd>

	    				<dt>Can I modify my box after / use my box for something else too? (Advanced.)</dt>
	    				<dd>No. Mail-in-a-Box must be installed on a <u>fresh</u> machine that will be <u>dedicated</u> to Mail-in-a-Box, and you cannot modify the box after installation (configuration changes will get overwritten by the box&rsquo;s self-management). If you are looking for something more advanced, try <a href="http://www.iredmail.org/">iRedMail</a> or <a href="https://github.com/tonioo/modoboa">Modoboa</a>.</dd>

	    			<h2 id="domain-name-registration">Your Domain Name</h2>

					<p><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-film"></i> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/v/HQOj-Mm1fYs&start=59&end=249">Watch a video of this step.</a></p>

	    			<p>The first step in setting up a Mail-in-a-Box is to pick your new email address. An email address has two parts. The part after the @-sign is the <b>domain name</b>. Each domain name is owned by someone, and you are going to be the owner of your own.</p>

	    				<p class="example">Josh&rsquo;s email address is <script>document.write("tj".split("").reverse().join(""));</script>@occams.info. His domain name is <code>occams.info</code>.</p>

	    			<p>Some domain names have quirks, depending on which &ldquo;top-level domain&rdquo; (TLD) it is under (.com, .me, .io, and so on). When choosing a domain name, please consult our <a href="tld-quirks.html">TLD quirks page</a> first.</p>

	    			<p>Now go over to <a href="http://www.gandi.net/domain">Gandi.net</a>, a domain name registrar, and buy a new domain name. It&rsquo;s about $17/year (depending on TLD). Buy anything you want. This is your new identity.</p>

	    			<p>After you buy the name you&rsquo;ll need to set it up, but that comes later so keep reading. Note that a Mail-in-a-Box box can handle the email for multiple domains names too &mdash; more on that later.</p>

	    			<h2 id="hostname">Your Box Has A Name</h2>

	    			<p>Every machine connected to the Internet has a <b>name</b> and an <b>address</b>.</p>

	    			<p>The <b>address</b>, an IP address, is like a telephone number. It&rsquo;s made up of numbers and is assigned to you by whoever provides Internet access to you.</p>

	    			<p>The name &mdash; called a <b>hostname</b> &mdash; is something you decide. It can be a domain name you own or any &ldquo;subdomain&rdquo; of a domain you own.</p>

	    			<p>For your Mail-in-a-Box, we recommend naming your box <code>box</code> + <code>.</code> + your domain name.</p>

	    				<p class="example">Josh&rsquo;s Mail-in-a-Box is named <code>box.occams.info</code>. This is its hostname.</p>

	    			<p>Your Mail-in-a-Box may handle the email for multiple domain names, but the box has a single name.</p>


	    			<h2 id="machine">The Machine</h2>

	    			<h3>Finding a cloud service provider</h3>

					<p><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-film"></i> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/v/HQOj-Mm1fYs&start=251&end=497">Watch a video of this step.</a></p>

	    			<p>Now you will rent a machine, or a virtual part of a machine, somewhere in &ldquo;the cloud.&rdquo; We&rsquo;ll call this machine your box.</p>

	    			<p>We recommend going over to <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a>. You must choose the <code>Ubuntu 14.04 x64</code> operating system. We recommend using a machine with 1 GB of RAM and a 30 GB disk. This setup currently costs $10/month.</p>

	    			<p>At Digital Ocean, your machine is called a &ldquo;droplet&rdquo; and you <strong>must</strong> name your droplet the same as its hostname.</p>

	    				<p class="example">Josh&rsquo;s droplet would be named <code>box.occams.info</code> (if Josh used Digital Ocean).</p>

	    			<p>I've been a long-time customer of <a href="http://rimuhosting.com/order/v2orderstart.jsp">Rimuhosting.com</a> which also provides cheap virtual machines, which they call &ldquo;VPS&rdquo;s, at several locations around the world. Choose a location near you &mdash; it&rsquo;ll be faster! Most any cloud provider will do, but not Amazon Web Services because its network is often blocked to prevent users from sending spam. Wherever you rent your box, you <em>must</em> choose Ubuntu 14.04 x64 and at least 768 MB RAM.</p>

	    			<p>Each cloud provider will have different instructions for setting up &ldquo;reverse DNS.&rdquo; You <strong>must</strong> follow your cloud provider&rsquo;s instructions for setting the reverse DNS of your box to your box&rsquo;s hostname. At Digital Ocean you set the name of your droplet to the box&rsquo;s hostname, as mentioned above.</p>

	    				<p class="example">Josh&rsquo;s box&rsquo;s reverse DNS is set to the same as the box&rsquo;s hostname: <code>box.occams.info</code>.</p>

	    			<p>Your cloud provider will also now tell you the IP address of your machine. It looks like 123.123.123.123.</p>

	    				<p class="example">Josh&rsquo;s box&rsquo;s IP address is <code>94.76.202.152</code>.</p>

	    			<h3>Firewall settings</h3>

	    			<p>If your machine is behind a hardware firewall (or virtual equivalent, such as an AWS security group), ensure that the following ports are open: 22 (SSH), 25 (SMTP), 53 (DNS; must be open for both tcp &amp; udp), 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 587 (SMTP submission), and 993 (IMAP). It doesn&rsquo;t hurt to block other ports, but your box will take care of that itself by configuring a software firewall on the machine itself.</p>


	    			<h2 id="domain-name-configuration">Configuring Your Domain Name</h2>

					<p><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-film"></i> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/v/HQOj-Mm1fYs&start=497&end=625">Watch a video of this step.</a></p>

	    			<p>We&rsquo;ll now go back to your domain name registrar to associate your domain name with your box&rsquo;s IP address.</p>

	    			<h3>Advanced: External DNS</h3>

	    			<p>If you are using an external DNS provider, e.g. if you already have a website on your domain name, you may skip this section. However, we recommend that you continue and let your box take over your DNS so that it can set it up securely and correctly for email.</p>

	    			<p>If you choose to skip this section, pay special attention to &ldquo;System status & DNS&rdquo; toward the end.</p>

	    			<h3>Glue Records</h3>

	    			<p>The association between your domain name and IP address is . . . complicated. The domain name system (DNS) is a global, distributed network of machines that turn domain names into IP addresses. Your registrar and your box play a role in the domain name system.</p>

	    			<p>The way this works varies from registrar to registrar, but it goes something like this:</p>

	    			<p>First, you&rsquo;ll create two &ldquo;glue records.&rdquo; The purpose of glue records is to say that your box is becoming a part of the domain name system. These records go by different names at different registrars, so also look out for &ldquo;hostnames&rdquo; or &ldquo;child nameservers.&rdquo;. This will <em>not</em> be found in a DNS control panel. [<a href="http://wiki.gandi.net/en/domains/management/change-glue">Gandi instructions</a> | <a href="https://support.godaddy.com/help/article/664/setting-nameservers-for-your-domain-names">GoDaddy instructions</a>]</p>

	    			<p>A glue record consists of a hostname and an IP address. You will need two: <code>ns1.</code> + your box&rsquo;s hostname and <code>ns2.</code> + your box&rsquo;s hostname. (They stand for &ldquo;nameserver one&rdquo; and &ldquo;nameserver two&rdquo;.) For the IP address, enter the IP address of your box.</p>

	    				<p class="example">Josh&rsquo;s box&rsquo;s hostname is box.occams.info. The two glue records are for <code>ns1.box.occams.info</code> and <code>ns2.box.occams.info</code> and list the box&rsquo;s IP address of <code>94.76.202.152</code>.</p>

	    			<p>It looks something like what&rsquo;s shown here:</p>

	    			<img src="static/domain_hostnames.png" title="Glue Record Configuration at Your Domain Registrar" class="img-responsive figure"/>

	    			<p>Your registrar may ask you to enter these hostnames with the domain name part omitted, as mine did in this case. If so, enter the part of the hostname up to the domain name.</p>

	    				<p class="example">Josh&rsquo;s domain name is occams.info. The two glue hostnames are <code>ns1.box.occams.info</code> and <code>ns2.box.occams.info</code>, but his registrar asks him to enter them with &ldquo;.occams.info&rdquo; omitted leaving just <code>ns1.box</code> and <code>ns2.box</code>.</p>

	    			<p>If your Mail-in-a-Box is handling mail for multiple domains, you only do the part above once. Other domain names skip this step.</p>

	    			<h3>Nameservers</h3>

	    			<p>Second, you&rsquo;ll tell your domain registrar that your domain name&rsquo;s nameservers are <code>ns1.</code> + your box&rsquo;s hostname and <code>ns2.</code> + your box&rsquo;s hostname.</p>

	    			<p>You will usually be turning off the registrar&rsquo;s provided nameservers and turning on custom servers. This is usually <i>not</i> found in the domain name&rsquo;s DNS control panel. You will be disabling that control panel.</p>

	    			<p>Here&rsquo;s what that looks like in my registrar:</p>

	    			<img src="static/domain_nameservers.png" title="Nameserver Configuration at Your Domain Registrar" class="img-responsive figure"/>

	    			<p>This part <em>is</em> repeated for each domain name you associate with your box.</p>

	    			<p>Don&rsquo;t worry if you are confused about what this all means. It is complicated &mdash; we all get confused at this point.</p>

	    			<h3>DNSSEC DS Record</h3>

	    			<p>DNSSEC adds a security layer on top of DNS, in the same way that HTTPS adds a security layer to HTTP. It is not necessary, but it is recommended. When enabled, mail between Mail-in-a-Boxes will always be encrpyted.</p>

	    			<p>Your box&rsquo;s control panel will tell you to come back to your domain name registrar at the end to configure the DNSSEC DS record. It&rsquo;s not something the box can set up on its own, but you also can&rsquo;t configure it until after the box itself is set up &mdash; so you will come back to this.</p>


					<h2 id="setup">Setting Up The Box</h2>

					<p><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-film"></i> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/v/HQOj-Mm1fYs&start=625&end=753">Watch a video of this step.</a></p>

					<p>You will now have to log into your running box using SSH. Your cloud provider will probably give you some instructions on how to do that. If your personal computer has a command line, you'll be doing something like this:</p>

					<pre>ssh -i yourkey.pem ubuntu@10.20.30.40</pre>

					<p>Once inside, you will now get the Mail-in-a-Box code onto your box and start its setup. Copy and paste this into your terminal and hit <key>enter</key>:</p>

					<pre>curl -s https://mailinabox.email/bootstrap.sh | sudo bash</pre>

					<p>You will be asked to enter the email address you want and a few other configuration questions. At the end you will be asked for a password for your email address.</p>

					<p>This password will be used to login to webmail, the administrative interface, and on your devices. It will <strong>not</strong> be used to log onto your Mail-in-a-Box server using SSH (that&rsquo;s what you did above).</p>

					<p>It is always safe to re-run the setup, either because something went wrong or you just want to see it again. You can do so by following two the steps above again or just running <code>sudo mailinabox</code> from the command line.</p>

					<p>When it comes time to update to a newer release of Mail-in-a-Box, you&rsquo;ll literally just run the above two commands again (<code>ssh ...</code> and then <code>curl ...</code>, as above) on your existing machine.</p>

					<h2 id="admin">The Administrative Interface</h2>

					<h3>Connecting for the First Time</h3>

					<p><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-film"></i> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/v/HQOj-Mm1fYs&start=753&end=790">Watch a video of this step.</a></p>

					<p>When the setup script is done running, you&rsquo;ll been given instructions on how to access your box&rsquo;s web-based administrative control panel:</p>

					<pre>Your Mail-in-a-Box is running.

Please log in to the control panel for further instructions at:

    https://94.76.202.152/admin

You will be alerted that the website has an invalid certificate. Check that
the certificate fingerprint matches:

C0:9B:FF:04:2B:2D:8F:47:5A:8B:D5:88:B7:05:D3:4B:6C:22:80:5F</pre>

					<p>Your SSL certificate is not yet signed so you will get a security warning when you visit the administrative URL. There is a way to proceed securely if you use Mozilla Firefox.</p>

					<ol>
					<li>Open the URL in Firefox. Firefox will say <em>This Connection is Untrusted</em>.</li>
					<li>Click on <em>I Understand the Risks</em>.</li>
					<li>Click on <em>Add Exception</em>.</li>
					<li>Click on <em>View</em>.</li>
					<li>Compare the <em>SHA1 Fingerprint</em> in Firefox to the fingerpint reported by Mail-in-a-Box&rsquo;s setup script in your SSH connection (see the example above). If they match, it is safe to continue.</li>
					<li>Click on <em>Close</em>.</li>
					<li>Click on <em>Confirm Security Exception</em>. It is safe (and convenient!) to permanently store the exception.</li>
					</ol>

					<p>The page will then load securely.</p>

					<p>You can also get a signed SSL certificate later (see below) so you don&rsquo;t have to go through these steps.</p>

					<h3>System status &amp; DNS</h3>

					<p><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-film"></i> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/v/HQOj-Mm1fYs&start=786&end=873">Watch a video of this step.</a></p>

					<p>Log in to the administrative control panel with the email address and password that you provided during Mail-in-a-Box&rsquo;s setup. Proceed to the System Status Checks.</p>

					<p>These checks will guide you toward finishing your setup:</p>

					<p>The control panel will check if your DNS is set up correctly. Things related to the domain name system sometimes take several minutes, or much longer, to update. This is called DNS propagation. Wait for the control panel to report no DNS problems &mdash; reload the page every 15 minutes or so. If problems persist, something went wrong.</p>

					<p>DNSSEC is an optional step that adds additional security to DNS. The control panel will walk you through setting up DNSSEC as well. You will need to go back to your domain name registrar and enter additional information.</p>

					<p><em>If you skipped the DNS settings earlier, you should now go to the DNS (Custom/External) &gt; External DNS section of the control panel and copy the DNS records into your own DNS control panel.</em></p>

					<h3>Getting a signed SSL certificate</h3>

					<p><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-film"></i> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/v/HQOj-Mm1fYs&start=873">Watch a video of this step.</a></p>

					<p>Getting a signed SSL certificate is optional but is highly recommended and will remove the security exception warnings from a) the control panel and b) when you start checking and sending mail. The control panel will walk you through this.</p>

					<p>If you skip this, you can still safely check your email if you verify any certificate warnings like above.</p>

					<h3>Checking your email</h3>

					<p>The administrative control panel will provide instructions for how to check your email with webmail, IMAP/SMTP, or Exchange/ActiveSync.</p>

					<p>You can also add or remove additional email accounts and mail aliases (forwarders).</p>

					<h3>Advanced tools</h3>

					<p>The administrative control panel also helps you with...</p>

					<ul>
					<li>Setting up contact and calendar synchronization</li>
					<li>Publishing a static website</li>
					<li>Checking the status of backups</li>
					<li>Setting custom DNS records, e.g. if you run a website on the same domain name but on another machine</li>
					</ul>

					<h2 id="maintenance">Keeping Your Box Humming</h2>

					<p>Follow <a href="http://twitter.com/Mailinabox">@Mailinabox</a> on Twitter so you know when we post any updates to Mail-in-a-Box.</p>

					<p>You should periodically update the software on Mail-in-a-Box. Every now and then update the Ubuntu base packages in case there have been any security updates. Log into your machine with SSH and then type:</p>

					<pre>sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade</pre>

					<p>You should also move to the latest Mail-in-a-Box release occasionally. Check the <a href="https://github.com/mail-in-a-box/mailinabox/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">release notes</a> for updates and review them before updating. Then go back to the section called <a href="#setup">Setting Up The Box</a> and simply follow the same steps again to update your box to the latest from us.</p>

					<p>Remember that it is always safe to re-run the setup script by typing <code>sudo mailinabox</code> at the SSH terminal prompt.</p>

					<h2 id="checks">Systems Checks</h2>

					<p>If you want to double-check that your system is configured correctly, here are some tools:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>DNS: <a href="http://pingability.com/zoneinfo.jsp">pingability.com/zoneinfo</a></li>
						<li>DKIM and SPF: <a href="http://www.brandonchecketts.com/emailtest.php">brandonchecketts.com/emailtest</a></li>
						<li>SSL: <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html">ssllabs.com</a></li>
					</ul>

					<h2 id="relaying">Relaying For Other Machines</h2>

					<p>If you have other machines on domains that are under the jurisdiction of your Mail-in-a-Box and they need to send mail (e.g. a webserver, or any machine that has cron jobs you want to see the output of) we recommend that you configure those machines to relay via the Mail-in-a-Box.</p>

					<p>If the remote machine is running Ubuntu 14.04 this can be done by applying the following steps to it. No changes are required on the Mail-in-a-Box itself (other than the creation of a mail account for the remote machine to authenticate with); <em>all commands that follow are to be run on the remote machine</em>.</p>

					<ol>
						<li>Run <code>sudo apt-get install postfix</code> and choose &ldquo;Satellite system&rdquo; when prompted.</li>
						<li>
							<p>Append the following seven lines to <code>/etc/postfix/main.cf</code>:</p>
							<pre><code>mydestination = 
smtp_use_tls = yes
smtp_tls_security_level = verify
smtp_tls_CAfile = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes
smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/relay_password
smtp_sasl_tls_security_options = </code></pre>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Write credentials in the following form to <code>/etc/postfix/relay_password</code> (substitute the second and third values with credentials for a freshly created account on the Mail-in-a-Box, and the first with the hostname of your Mail-in-a-Box):</p>
							<pre><code>yourmailinabox.yourdomain relayusername:relaypassword</code></pre>
							<p>The account that you create on Mail-in-a-Box for this purpose can be on any of the domains that your Mail-in-a-Box manages, as the only requirement on mail sent by the remote machine is that it is from <em>a</em> domain that the Mail-in-a-Box manages. You may want to create an alias on your Mail-in-a-Box so that any replies sent to automatically generated messages get routed to your own inbox; otherwise they will accumulate in the inbox of the relay account.</p>
						</li>
						<li>chmod the password file to 600 (<code>sudo chmod 600 /etc/postfix/relay_password</code>), run <code>sudo postmap /etc/postfix/relay_password</code> and then reload postfix (<code>sudo service postfix reload</code>).</li>
					</ol>
                    
					<p>And that's it. Mail created and dispatched on the remote machine will now be routed via your Mail-in-a-Box.</p>
 
					<p>You can send a test email on the remote machine by running:</p>

					<pre>echo "relay test" | mail -s "relay test" destinationuser@destinationdomain</pre>
