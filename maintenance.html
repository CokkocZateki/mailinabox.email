	    			<h1>Mail-in-a-Box Maintenance Guide</h1>

	    			<p>This page covers frequently asked questions about how to configure a running Mail-in-a-Box and how to keep it up to date. For help setting up a new box, see the <a href="guide.html">setup guide</a>.</p>

	    			<h2 id="something-went-wrong">Something Went Wrong!</h2>

	    			<p>Is something not working right? Start here. Please follow these steps before asking a question on the discussion forum:</p>

	    			<ol>
	    			<li>Check your System Status Checks page in the control panel at <code>https://box.yourdomain.com/admin</code>. Everything should be green. Anything not green may help you diagnose the problem on your own.</li>
	    			<li>Re-run the setup by logging into your box (using the same <code>ssh</code> command that you used <a href="guide.html#setup">during setup</a>) and running <code>sudo mailinabox</code>. Then check the System Status Checks page again.</li>
	    			<li>Restart your box by logging in with SSH and then typing <code>sudo reboot</code>. Once the box has started up, check the System Status Checks page again.</li>
	    			</ol>

	    			<p>Please do these steps first. If you&rsquo;ve done these steps, then head to the <a href="https://discourse.mailinabox.email">discussion forum</a> to ask your question. In your post:</p>

	    			<ol>
	    			<li>Describe the problem you are having. Instead of saying &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t work&rdquo;, write the error message you see, post a screenshot, or describe what you are seeing that you don&rsquo;t want to be seeing.</li>
	    			<li>Mention that you &ldquo;checked the status page, re-ran setup, and rebooted the box&rdquo;, per the steps above, so that anyone answering knows what you have tried so far. If you don&rsquo;t mention this, someone may ask you to do it before providing other assistance.</li>
	    			<li>If everything in the System Status Checks is green, mention that by saying &ldquo;all checks are green&rdquo;. If something isn&rsquo;t green, mention it.</li>
	    			</ol>

	    			<p>If you figure out the problem on your own, you are also welcome to write up your experience on the <a href="https://discourse.mailinabox.email">discussion forum</a> so that it might help others.</p>


	    			<h2 id="multiple-domains">Multiple Domain Names</h2>

	    			<p>Your box can host email and serve static websites for more than one domain name. To set up additional domain names, just follow three steps:</p>

	    			<ol>
	    			<li>Buy an additional domain name if you don&rsquo;t yet own it. See the <a href="guide.html#domain-name-registration">Your Domain Name</a> section of the setup guide for tips.</li>
	    			<li>Configure its nameservers to be the same nameservers on your first domain name. Follow the <a href="guide.html#domain-name-nameservers">Domain Name Configuration â€” Nameservers</a> section of the setup guide for instructions.</li>
	    			<li>Add an email account (user) or alias on your box for the new domain name using the control panel. If you only plan to serve a website, still add an email address or alias &mdash; that&rsquo;s how the box knows to handle that domain name.</li>
	    			</ol>


	    			<h2 id="updating-software">Updating System Software</h2>

	    			<p>Mail-in-a-Box is based on a collection of other software packages provided by <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>. We call these packages system software packages. These packages may have security or other functionality updates.</p>

					<p>You should periodically update the system software on your box. The box will automatically install security updates as they are made available by Ubuntu, but your control panel will let you know if a reboot is needed or if non-security updates are available for you to install.</p>

					<p>When indicated to do so, log into your machine with SSH (using the same <code>ssh</code> command that you used <a href="guide.html#setup">during setup</a>) and then type:</p>

					<pre>sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade</pre>

					<p>If prompted to reboot, type:</p>

					<pre>sudo reboot</pre>

					<p>We will post security advisories to our twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/mailinabox">@mailinabox</a>, the <a href="https://discourse.mailinabox.email/c/announcements">announcements section of the discussion forum</a>, and our Slack chat (see the homepage).</p>


	    			<h2 id="upgrade">Upgrading Mail-in-a-Box</h2>

					<p>You should move to the latest Mail-in-a-Box release as releases are posted, especially if an update addresses any security issues, although you do not necessarily need to do so. We will post release announcements to our twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/mailinabox">@mailinabox</a>, the <a href="https://discourse.mailinabox.email/c/announcements">announcements section of the discussion forum</a>, and our Slack chat (see the homepage).</p>

					<p>Check the <a href="https://github.com/mail-in-a-box/mailinabox/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">release notes</a> prior to updating to see what&rsquo;s been changed in the latest version.</p>

					<p>To upgrade Mail-in-a-Box to the latest release, first log into your machine using <code>SSH</code> in exactly the same manner as when you were setting up the box (see the setup guide section called <a href="guide.html#setup">Setting Up The Box</a> for a reminder of what that looked like).</p>

					<p>Then, once logged in, run:</p>

					<pre>curl -s https://mailinabox.email/setup.sh | sudo bash</pre>

					<p>This is actually the same command you ran when setting up the box. It does upgrades too.</p>


	    			<h2 id="moving-boxes">Moving to a New Box</h2>

	    			<p>If you want to move your Mail-in-a-Box installation to a new machine (e.g. you&rsquo;re getting more memory, getting a new IP address, etc.), or if something is horribly wrong with your box, you can easily move all of your data to a new machine.</p>

	    			<p>Follow these steps:</p>

	    			<ol>
	    			<li>Spin up the new machine following the setup guide&rsquo;s section <a href="guide.html#machine">The Machine</a>.</li>
	    			<li>Update your domain name&rsquo;s glue records to the new machine&rsquo;s IP address (see the setup guide&rsquo;s section on <a href="guide.html#machine">glue records</a>.</li>
	    			<li>Copy the <code>/home/user-data</code> directory on your old machine to the same location your new machine. See below for tips.</li>
	    			<li>Continue the setup guide from <a href="guide.html#setup">Setting Up The Box</a>.</li>
	    			</ol>

	    			<p>To copy your <code>/home/user-data</code> directory, you can run this command (from your personal home computer if Linux or Mac):</p>

	    			<pre>scp -r -i yourkey.pem ubuntu@old-machine-ip-address:/home/user-data ubuntu@new-machine-ip-address:/home/user-data</pre>

	    			<p>This is all one line. Replace <code>ubuntu@old-machine-ip-address</code> depending on the SSH login instructions provided to you by your old cloud provider &mdash; like how you logged in with SSH to the machine originally. Similarly replace <code>ubuntu@new-machine-ip-address</code> with the appropriate SSH login information for your new machine. I&rsquo;s included <code>-i yourkey.pem</code> if your instructions include a private key, but only include this if you were instructed to do so.</p>

	    			<p>You can also use any SFTP program to copy the files, such as <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a>. Your SFTP login will be exactly the same as your SSH login on each machine (possibly with an identical private key file).</p>
